# Codewars
"Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment. On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions."

# My Code
Shared here are my solutions to various "Katas" (Codewars' challenges). Included in each file is the prompt followed by my code and tests to show that the code works provide examples for its functionality. All solutions were written by me in Python3; I tried to maintain a balance between industry standard solutions and cleverness.
